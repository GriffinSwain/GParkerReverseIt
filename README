This program takes a user's input, displays it, and then writes out the same input but reversed
It then asks the user if they want to play again and loops until the user types 'yes' or 'no'

On top of vaildating if the user wants to play again Griffin went above and 
beyond and vailated that the user enter more than a single character or if 
the user just entered the space bar. On top of that yes theres more Giffin 
also added another feature where the resevered response is slowly typed out. 
They not only hit every checkmark on the assignment Griffin also added some 
impresive features that werent demanded of him.
